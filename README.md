If you are new at development and don't know what to do to demonstrate your skills, this repo is to you :D

## How this works?

This repo gives ideas to small apps that can show different fields of basic programming to create your initial portolio. Also shows how to create those apps and where to find the knowledge enough to do it. ENJOY!

### CSS

To create some interesting css projects you can dig into some important aspects of css beyond basics, that they are:

1. CSS3
- Where to learn: [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS3).
- Small examples: [Submarine](https://codepen.io/ajerez/pen/EaEEOW), [Loader](https://codepen.io/Bidji/pen/dPEzwq) and [Star Wars](https://codepen.io/donovanh/pen/pJzwEw).
- What you can do: You could do a simple draw with some animation or make some buttons with [transitions effects](https://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2014/05/8-simple-css3-transitions-that-will-wow-your-users/).
2. Bootstrap
- Where to learn: [GetBootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/).
- Small examples: [simple examples](https://tutorialzine.com/2015/06/12-time-saving-bootstrap-examples).- What you can do: You can do a responsive page using bootstrap col-system with 3 different components of bootstrap.
3. Layout systems (flexbox and grid)
- Where to learn: [Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) and [GRID](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/).
- Small examples:
- What you can do: You can create a page a little more complex layout with several columns and responsive to not just phones but also tablets.
4. Pre-processors (sass or less)
- Where to learn: [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/guide) and [Less](http://lesscss.org/).
- Small examples:
- What you can do: You can translate some of your older projects to sass or less and compare the difference between them and css.

### Javascript

1. DOM
- Where to learn: [Mastering the DOM access](http://krasimirtsonev.com/blog/article/Mastering-the-DOM-access-JavaScript-set-get-value)and [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom.asp).
- Small examples:[W3Schools examples](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_dom_examples.asp).
- What you can do: You can create a form that sends data through the DOM and display the text inside a 'ul' list.
 2. AJAX requests
- Where to learn: [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/pt-BR/docs/AJAX) and [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_ajax_intro.asp).
- Small examples:
